English to Hindi Machine Translation using LSTM-based Sequence-to-Sequence Model

## Project Description
This project aims to create a machine translation system that converts English sentences into their Hindi counterparts. The core technology employed is LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks, which are well-suited for handling sequential data. The project is structured into distinct phases for data preprocessing, building the encoder-decoder architecture, and implementing the LSTM models.
Technologies: NLP, LSTM, RNN
